allow2linux
===========

Placeholder for someone to port the allow2mac system over to linux.

It is intended to be a time-control system for linux-based OS systems.

It provides a concrete example of how to perform a full-featured integration with the Allow2 service via the open-source allow2deviceAPI.

The intention, by outsourcing, is to:

1. Accelerate development,
2. Provide an example for integration into device firmware and other application software
